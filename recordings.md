# Recordings

The LGM talks should be recorded.

The workshops have never (or mostly not) been recorded.

If we get into any agreement with third party platforms, companies, or organisation that might be relevant for the participants (e.g. "We sponsor the recordings, but they need to be pubslihed on our platform")

- We shall ensure that the participants (and most of all the presenters) are aware of it.
- The obligations might be invalidated, if the other partiy changes in relevant ways their terms of services (or the ownserships changes in a relevant way).
- The clause should carry a minimal duration, binding for both parts (e.g. "the videos shall be on the platform for at least n years")

## River Valley TV

From 2007 to 2009 the LGM, River Valley TV recorded the talks and published the result on their own platform.

Some of the recordings might still be available through <https://archive.org>: <http://river-valley.tv/>

## The Gimp team

For some of the LGMs, the Gimp team has taken care of the camera, recording and publishing of the recordings (mostly in the case, where the local organizer did not think of it or was not able to set it up)

## ChaosWest TV, Nuremberg, 2025

The video team of [ChaosWest_TV](https://chaoswest.tv/) provided the material and the crew for the recordings and the live stream.

They might support further events on request, if contacted early enough.  
Please use the address in their "Kontakt" page, to get in touch with them and check if they can be available for _your_ LGM.  
(Their page is in German, but can easily be automatically translated.)

## Excluding Recordings from specific platforms

Raphael B. asked for removing (three of) his talks from 2014 and 2014 from Github.

We need to check what was the contract with Google for that LGM (if any).

As a first measure we have made sure that

- "Disable interest-based ads" is checked.
- "Third party training" is unchecked.
