# Recordings

The LGM talks should be recorded.

The workshops have never (or mostly not) been recorded.

# River Valley TV

From 2007 to 2009 the LGM, River Valley TV recorded the talks and published the result on their own platform.

Some of the recordings might still be available through <https://archive.org>: <http://river-valley.tv/>

# The Gimp team

For some of the LGMs, the Gimp team has taken care of the camera, recording and publishing of the recordings (mostly in the case, where the local organizer did not think of it or was not able to set it up)

## ChaosWest TV, Nuremberg, 2025

The video team of [CWTV](https://chaoswest.tv/) provided the material and the crew for the recordings and the live stream.

They might support further events on request, if contacted early enough.  
Please use the address in their "Kontakt" page, to get in touch with them and check if they can be available for _your_ LGM.
