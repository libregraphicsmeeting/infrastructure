- Each adminstrator has to create his/her own account and ask one of the existing adminstators for being added to `lgm` group
- then you can connect yourself to `ssh.tuxfamily.org`

# The website

- `lgm/` contains the wordpress instance for the general information on the LGM
- `2007/`-`2015/` contains the site for each year's LGM (the last one as a wordpress instance, the other ones as static html)

## The databases
